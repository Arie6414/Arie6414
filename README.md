- 👋 Hi, I’m @Arie6414
- 👀 I’m interested in;
    - Home Assistant
    - Home automation
    - Home networking (Unifi and Synology)
    - Smart technology and AI in drones
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so much. I am not a developer, more like a hobbiest, but i am willing to learn because it is interesting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my own wine platform (wine-xplorer.nl) and other cool projects were i can learn
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am good at breaking stuff instead of fixing them.
